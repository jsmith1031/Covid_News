### Setting up Flutter

Following this tutorial: [codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter#1\
Download the flutter SDK  [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)\
Since flutter is almost 3GB, I suggest moving the directory location before adding to enviroment path variables.\
Once you have flutter installed, if you're using Visual Studio Code, download the Flutter extension from the marketplace. If not, there are tools for using Flutter with other IDEs  [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal)\
