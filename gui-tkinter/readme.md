# Tkinter based GUI for BOT

- We have created a tkinter based graphic user interface for COVIDBOT. 
- The **gui.py** file is the main application file where we create a chatbot using tkinter, take inputs from the user and make call to get_response.py to get the BOT response.
- **get_response.py** makes call to webscrapper programs to get the data (news, article and COVID-19 cases).
- **tkHyperlink.py** files is used to create hyperlink inside tkinter text widget.
- Webscrapper folder consists of webscrapping programs to fetch data.
